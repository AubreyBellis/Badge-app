## **PURPOSE:**

Yearbook_on_rails is exactly as it sounds. It's a digital, moving yearbook. Limitless data can be stored and without using paper! In the future I hope to build more of it out to add clubs and other 'typical' moments most are used to seeing in todays yearbooks.. and add an external API to it at as well. 

## **TOOLS USED**

- React
- Rails
- Google Fonts
- Imgur
