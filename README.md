## **PURPOSE:**

Yearbook_on_rails is exactly as it sounds. It's a digital, moving yearbook. Limitless data can be stored and without using paper! The 3rd party API I've chosen for the moment is 'They Said So'. It generates a random, inspirational quotes daily. In the future I hope to build more of it out to add clubs and other 'typical' moments most are used to seeing in todays yearbooks. 

## **TOOLS USED**

- React
- Rails
